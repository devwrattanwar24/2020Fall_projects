# Analyzing New York City Arrests, Complaints, and Stop, Question, Frisk Data

## Overview

NYC, commonly referred to as the 'Big Apple', is one of the most populous city in the United States of America. A high population indicates a larger economic unit comprising of multiple industries. However, it also indicates more number of crimes, and more number of complaints from civilians who are victims of these crimes. One of the key factors that determines a city's quality of life is the safety of the individuals. Keeping this in mind, we decided to perform some analysis on the data available about the same. We decided to come up with hypotheses centered around racial backgrounds, age and gender to determine if individuals with a certain background are subjected to prejudice. All of the data that we have worked on is public data and is made available by NYC Open Data (https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/). Our analysis will be beneficial for those who wish to know more about the city of New York, individuals who wish to settle in the Big Apple, as well as relevant authorities who might see this analysis as a way to bring about positive change by identifying areas of improvement.

## Datasets used for Analysis
Stop, Question and Frisk Data - https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/The-Stop-Question-and-Frisk-Data/ftxv-d5ix </br>
NYPD Complaint Data Historic - https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i </br>
NYPD Arrest Data Historic - https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrest-Data-Year-to-Date-/uip8-fykc </br>

Although these data sources comprise of records from over a decade, we have focused our analysis on records from the year 2019 i.e. incidents that occured in the 2019 (01/01/2019 - 12/31/2019). Instead of filtering the data after loading it in python, which would be computationally exhaustive, we filtered the data from NYC Open Data's website and downloaded appropriate versions of the files.
